This repository contains my solutions of problems of C++ Modern Development Specialization. The specialization consists of five courses.

Previously, this course could be taken on the Coursera. This course is now available on Stepik. You can study the information or sign up [at this link](cppcourse.ru).

I will gradually add tasks' descriptions for those tasks that need it.
